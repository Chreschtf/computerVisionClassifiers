The following coursework is done using Matlab.
The files containing the code for implementations are
	1.run1.m
	2.run2.m
	3.run3.m
Before running these code add the following folder into the path
	
	1.training image folder(Extracted from zip)
	2.testing image folder(Extracted from zip)

//---------run1.m----------//
This m files contains the for tiny features and KNN.
It could be compiled and run directly.
The resultant outut is stored in a text file run1.txt
//---------run2.m----------//
Contains the implementation of linear classifiers using 
bag of visual words.
Before running the code clear the workspace directory.
After the run the code.Output will be stored in run2.txt
//---------run3.m----------//
Classifier
This code could be run directly after opening.
Output save in run3.txt
